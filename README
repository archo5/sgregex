--- SGRegex [SRX] regular expression library v0.97b ---

Simple and fully featured regular expression library with a minimalistic implementation in C.

usage:
- add regex.h and regex.c to your project

support:
- "." (dot)
- "*", "+", "?" (simple quantifiers)
- "{<num>}", "{<num1>,<num2>}" (complex quantifiers)
- "[...]", "[^...]" (character classes)
- "(...)" (subexpressions/capture ranges)
- "|" (the "or" operator)
- "^", "$" (beginning/end matchers)
- "*?", "+?" (lazy quantifiers)
- modifier "m" - multiline
- modifier "i" - case insensitive matcing
- modifier "s" - dot includes newlines

change log:
0.98b:
- fixed backtracing after breaking out of the subexpr. at the middle
- improved on logging, added a memory limit, added test samples
- fixed lots of compiler warnings
0.97b:
- fixed counter resetting (it is now done on backtracking)
0.96b:
- fixed a compilation issue, near-infinite loop bug in the last 2 test cases
- added extensive debug logging (#define RXLOG 1 to enable)
0.95b:
- initial release

API documentation:

> function srx_Create
(
	const RX_Char* regex, // the regular expression
	const RX_Char* mods // modifier char list
)
- creates a regular expression matcher from the specified expression and modifier list
- returns the regular expression matcher ("context")

> function srx_CreateExt
(
	const RX_Char* regex, // the regular expression
	const RX_Char* mods, // modifier char list (optional)
	int* errnpos, // pointer to an array of *two* int values: error code and error position (optional)
	srx_MemFunc memfn, // memory allocation function (optional)
	void* memctx // user pointer to pass to the allocation function (optional)
);
- creates a regular expression matcher from the specified expression and modifier list
- allows to specify custom memory allocation and error output
- returns the regular expression matcher ("context")

> function srx_Destroy
(
	srx_Context* R // the regex matcher context
)
- destroys the created matcher object

> function srx_DumpToStdout
(
	srx_Context* R // the regex matcher context
)
- dumps the structure of the context to standard output

> function srx_Match
(
	srx_Context* R, // the regex matcher context
	const RX_Char* str, // the string to use for matching
	int offset // the starting point for matching
)
- searches for a match through the string
- offset is not "approached safely" (with a loop to check for a NUL-byte)
- returns whether a match was found

> function srx_GetCaptureCount
(
	srx_Context* R // the regex matcher context
)
- returns the number of capture ranges that were found in the expression (there's always at least one - the whole match)
- the current upper limit is 10 (including the whole match)

> function srx_GetCaptured
(
	srx_Context* R, // the regex matcher context
	int which, // the capture range number
	int* pbeg, // pointer to output for start offset (optional)
	int* pend // pointer to output for end offset (optional)
)
- retrieves the offsets from the specified capture range
- returns if the capture range number is in range and if the last match included the capture range (which also means that data was written to specified pointers)

> function srx_GetCapturedPtrs
(
	srx_Context* R, // the regex matcher context
	int which, // the capture range number
	const RX_Char** pbeg, // pointer to output for start offset pointer (optional)
	const RX_Char** pend // pointer to output for end offset pointer (optional)
)
- retrieves the offset pointers from the specified capture range
- returns if the capture range number is in range and if the last match included the capture range (which also means that data was written to specified pointers)

> function srx_Replace
(
	srx_Context* R, // the regex matcher contex
	const RX_Char* str, // the input string
	const RX_Char* rep // the replacement string (supports capture ranges in the form of "\1")
)
- replaces occurrences of pattern in string `str` with string `rep`, returns the replaced string
- the returned string is allocated with the registered allocator

> function srx_FreeReplaced
(
	srx_Context* R,
	RX_Char* repstr
)
- frees the string returned by srx_Replace
